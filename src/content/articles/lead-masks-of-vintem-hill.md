On the afternoon of August 20, 1966, a teenager was flying a kite on Morro do Vintém (Vintém Hill) in Niterói, just across the bay from Rio de Janeiro, when he stumbled onto something that would become one of Brazil's most enduring mysteries. Lying side by side on the grassy hillside were two men. They wore formal suits and waterproof coats. Over their eyes, each wore a crude mask fashioned from lead.

They were dead. And no one could explain why.

The Lead Masks of Vintem Hill case has everything: two electronics technicians from a small town, a cryptic note with instructions to "ingest capsules" and "await signal," a UFO sighting over the hill on the same night, connections to "scientific spiritualism," and an autopsy that was delayed so long the bodies decomposed before toxicology could be performed.

Over half a century later, no cause of death has ever been established. The case remains officially unsolved.

## Who Were the Victims?

The two men were identified as **Manoel Pereira da Cruz** and **Miguel José Viana**, both electronics technicians from Campos dos Goytacazes, a town several hundred kilometers northeast of Rio de Janeiro. They were friends and colleagues, both experienced in electronics repair.

Neither man had a criminal record or known enemies. They were described by friends and family as intelligent, curious, and interested in topics beyond their professional work. What those topics included would become central to the investigation.

After the deaths, searches of the men's homes turned up materials related to spiritualism and mask-making. A friend named Élcio Gomes later revealed that the two men, along with Gomes himself, had built some kind of device in Manoel's garden about two months before the deaths. The device had exploded. What it was intended to do remains unclear, though some accounts suggest it was related to attempts at "spiritual contact" or communication experiments.

## What Happened on August 17, 1966?

Police reconstructed the men's final movements through witness statements and physical evidence.

On the morning of August 17, Cruz and Viana left Campos dos Goytacazes, telling their families they were going to purchase materials for work. They boarded a bus to Niterói and arrived at approximately 2:30 PM.

Once in Niterói, they made two purchases: waterproof coats from a local shop and a bottle of water from a bar. The waitress at the bar later told police that Miguel appeared "very nervous" and kept checking his watch, as if he had an appointment to keep.

That's the last confirmed sighting of either man alive.

It's presumed they went directly from the bar to Morro do Vintém. The hill is a moderately steep, overgrown area with dense vegetation. Reaching the spot where their bodies were later found would have required a significant climb.

Three days later, on August 20, the kite-flying teenager found them. When police and firefighters attempted to reach the bodies, they struggled with the difficult terrain and didn't arrive until the following day.

## What Did Police Find at the Scene?

The scene was unlike anything investigators had encountered:

- **Two bodies**, lying side by side, partially covered by tall grass
- **Both men wearing formal suits** and waterproof coats
- **Crude eye masks made from lead**, covering each man's eyes
- **An empty water bottle**
- **A packet containing two wet towels**
- **A small notebook** with a cryptic handwritten entry

![Close-up of a hand writing with a pen on paper, like the cryptic note found beside the bodies on Vintem Hill](https://images.pexels.com/photos/5425602/pexels-photo-5425602.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940)

There were no signs of physical trauma on either body. No evidence of a struggle. No visible wounds. The men appeared to have simply lain down on the hillside and died.

The lead masks were simple constructions, not elaborate or professional. They were essentially eye covers made from sheets of lead, shaped to fit over the eyes like crude blindfolds. Lead is heavy and opaque, qualities that would block both light and certain types of radiation.

## What Did the Cryptic Note Say?

The notebook found at the scene contained what appeared to be a set of instructions, written in Portuguese:

> *"16:30 estar no local determinado. 18:30 ingerir cápsulas, após efeito proteger metais aguardar sinal mascara"*

Translated to English:

> *"16:30 be at the specified location. 18:30 ingest capsules, after the effect protect metals await signal mask"*

This note is the single most important and most debated piece of evidence in the case. It reads like a checklist or protocol:

1. Arrive at the designated location by 4:30 PM
2. At 6:30 PM, take capsules
3. After the capsules take effect, protect the metals (presumably the lead masks)
4. Await a signal
5. Put on the masks

The note implies that both men expected something to happen, something that would require eye protection and would be preceded by a "signal." They didn't stumble into danger. They prepared for it. They had a schedule, a procedure, and specialized equipment.

What they were waiting for is the central question of the case.

## Why Were They Wearing Lead Masks?

The lead masks are the detail that gives this case its name and its eeriness. Why would two electronics technicians bring crude lead eye covers to a remote hillside?

Lead blocks visible light completely. It also blocks certain forms of radiation, which is why it's used in X-ray shielding. If the men believed they were going to witness something that produced blinding light or dangerous radiation, lead masks would be a logical (if crude) protective measure.

The fact that mask-making materials were found at their homes suggests this wasn't improvised. They'd prepared the masks in advance, probably at home in Campos dos Goytacazes, and brought them to the hill as part of whatever ritual or experiment they were conducting.

The combination of the masks, the note's reference to a "signal," and the men's backgrounds in electronics has led to several theories about what they thought was going to happen on that hillside.

## Was There a UFO Sighting That Night?

Yes, and it's one of the most debated aspects of the case.

On the evening of August 17, the same night Cruz and Viana are believed to have died, a woman named Gracinda Barbosa Coutinho da Sousa was driving with three of her children through the Fonseca neighborhood of Niterói. She and her children reported seeing "an oval-shaped object, of an orangy colour, with a band of fire around its edges," hovering over the top of a hill and "sending out rays in all directions."

Brazilian newspapers reported the sighting, and the area around Morro do Vintém was already considered something of a UFO hotspot by locals.

The UFO connection transformed the case from a local police mystery into an international sensation. The March 1967 issue of *Flying Saucer Review*, a British publication, covered the case under the title "The Mystery of the Morro do Vintem."

Whether the UFO sighting is related to the men's deaths is, of course, impossible to verify. Coincidences do happen. But the overlap in timing and location, combined with the note's reference to awaiting a "signal," has kept the UFO theory alive for decades.

## The Scientific Spiritualism Theory

The most widely accepted theory comes from a friend of the two men, who told investigators they were members of a group of "scientific spiritualists." In 1960s Brazil, spiritualism (particularly traditions influenced by Kardecism, a form of spiritism popular in Brazil) was widespread and often blended with scientific curiosity.

According to this theory, Cruz and Viana believed they could contact extraterrestrial beings or spirits through a combination of psychedelic or psychoactive substances and specific rituals. The lead masks were meant to protect their eyes from the blinding light they expected to accompany the contact. The "capsules" mentioned in the note were drugs intended to facilitate the experience.

This theory is supported by several pieces of evidence:

- The cryptic note reads like a ritual protocol
- Mask-making materials and spiritualist literature were found at their homes
- The exploded device in Manoel's garden suggests prior experimentation
- Their friend Élcio Gomes confirmed their involvement in contact experiments
- 1960s Brazil had a thriving subculture of groups attempting spirit or alien contact

If this theory is correct, the two men climbed Vintém Hill on August 17, took their positions at 4:30 PM, ingested their capsules at 6:30 PM, put on their lead masks, and waited for a signal that never came. What killed them was the capsules themselves, whether through accidental overdose, a toxic substance they didn't understand, or a deliberate act of self-harm.

## Could It Have Been a Drug Overdose?

The drug overdose theory is the most straightforward explanation, and it aligns with the note's instruction to "ingest capsules." If the men took psychoactive or toxic substances as part of their ritual, the capsules could have killed them.

But there's a critical problem: we don't know what killed them.

The autopsy was delayed for weeks. By the time it was conducted, the men's internal organs had decomposed beyond the point where reliable toxicology testing could be performed. No poison, no drug, no cause of death was ever identified.

This failure is the single biggest obstacle to solving the case. If a proper autopsy had been performed within days of the discovery, we'd likely know exactly what the capsules contained and whether they caused the deaths. Instead, we're left with a note that references capsules and no forensic evidence of what was in them.

## Why Was No Cause of Death Determined?

The Niterói coroner's office was extremely busy in August 1966, and the bodies weren't prioritized. By the time pathologists got to Cruz and Viana, decomposition had advanced to the point where standard toxicology tests were unreliable.

No obvious injuries were found. No external trauma, no gunshot wounds, no stab wounds, no signs of strangulation. Whatever killed them left no visible marks on their bodies.

The delay in the autopsy is perhaps the greatest tragedy of the investigation. With modern forensic techniques, even a delayed examination might yield results. But in 1966, once the organs had decomposed, the evidence was gone.

The case was featured on *Linha Direta Justiça*, a Brazilian true crime television show, in 2004, which brought renewed attention but no new forensic breakthroughs.

## What Questions Remain?

The Lead Masks case endures because it's a puzzle with too many strange pieces and not enough answers:

**What were the capsules?** The note says to take them. No capsules were found at the scene, and no toxicology was performed. Were they psychedelic drugs? A poison? Something the men believed would open their minds to contact?

**What "signal" were they waiting for?** The note references awaiting a signal after the capsules took effect. A UFO? A spiritual manifestation? A signal from a third party who never arrived?

**Was anyone else involved?** The men traveled alone, but did they have a contact or leader who told them where to go and what to take? Élcio Gomes knew about their experiments. Were there others?

**Why Vintém Hill?** Was the location chosen for its reputation as a UFO hotspot? Was it simply remote enough for a private ritual? Or had someone directed them there?

**Is the UFO sighting connected?** The timing is striking, but eyewitness UFO reports are common and unreliable. It could be a coincidence.

The Lead Masks of Vintem Hill is a case that resists easy categorization. It's not quite a murder mystery, not quite a UFO case, not quite a cult story. It's all of them and none of them, and it sits at a strange intersection of 1960s Brazilian spiritualism, Cold War paranoia, and two men who believed they were about to make contact with something beyond ordinary experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the lead masks in the Vintem Hill case?

They were crude eye coverings made from sheets of lead, shaped to fit over the eyes like blindfolds. Lead blocks visible light and certain types of radiation. The men likely made them at home (mask-making materials were found at their residences) and brought them to the hillside as part of whatever ritual or experiment they were conducting.

### How did Manoel Pereira da Cruz and Miguel José Viana die?

The cause of death was never determined. The autopsy was delayed for weeks, and by the time it was performed, the bodies had decomposed beyond the point where toxicology tests could produce reliable results. No external injuries were found.

### Were the lead masks deaths related to a UFO sighting?

On the same evening the men are believed to have died, a woman and her children reported seeing an oval, orange-colored object hovering over a hill in Niterói. The area was already considered a UFO hotspot. Whether the sighting is connected to the deaths has never been established.

### What did the note found at the scene say?

The note, written in Portuguese, translates to: "16:30 be at the specified location. 18:30 ingest capsules, after the effect protect metals await signal mask." It reads like a set of instructions for a ritual or procedure involving capsules and the lead eye masks.

### Were Cruz and Viana involved in a cult?

Not a cult in the traditional sense, but they were reportedly members of a group of "scientific spiritualists" who experimented with contacting extraterrestrial or spiritual entities. Literature on spiritualism and mask-making materials were found in their homes. Their friend confirmed they'd been conducting contact experiments, including building a device that had exploded weeks earlier.
