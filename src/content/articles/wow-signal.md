On the night of August 15, 1977, the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University was scanning the sky as part of SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The telescope was running on autopilot, recording data to a printout that would be reviewed later by volunteers. When astronomer Jerry Ehman sat down to examine the data a few days later, one sequence of characters jumped off the page.

6EQUJ5.

That string of letters and numbers represented a signal that was so far outside what the telescope normally recorded that Ehman circled it in red pen and wrote a single word in the margin: "Wow!"

That signal, lasting 72 seconds and never detected again despite decades of searching, has become the strongest candidate we've ever found for an extraterrestrial radio transmission. It matched every criterion scientists had established for what an alien signal should look like. And yet, we still can't say definitively what it was.

## What Exactly Was the Wow! Signal?

To understand why the Wow! Signal was so remarkable, you need to understand how the Big Ear telescope worked and what it was looking for.

The Big Ear was a fixed radio telescope, meaning it didn't move. Instead, it relied on the Earth's rotation to sweep its beam across the sky. Any given point in the sky would pass through the telescope's field of view over the course of about 72 seconds. If a signal lasted exactly that long, it meant the source was fixed in the sky, not on Earth and not from a satellite moving through the field of view.

The Wow! Signal lasted exactly 72 seconds. It rose in intensity as the source entered the beam, peaked, and fell off as the source exited. This profile was a textbook match for a celestial point source.

The signal was detected at a frequency of 1420.4556 MHz. This isn't a random frequency. It's the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe. In 1959, physicists Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison published a landmark paper arguing that 1420 MHz would be the most logical frequency for interstellar communication because any technologically advanced civilization would know it's significant. The SETI community widely adopted this reasoning.

The signal was also narrowband, meaning it occupied a very small slice of the radio spectrum. Natural astronomical sources tend to emit across a wide range of frequencies. Narrowband signals are characteristic of artificial transmitters. The Wow! Signal was the narrowest signal the Big Ear had ever detected.

In the alphanumeric system used to record signal intensity, the sequence 6EQUJ5 represented a signal that peaked at roughly 30 times the background noise level. The "U" at the center represented the highest intensity, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of about 30:1. Nothing even close to this had been recorded before or since on the Big Ear.

## Where Did It Come From?

The Big Ear had two feed horns, each pointed at a slightly different part of the sky. The signal was detected in only one of the two horns. Because the two horns scanned slightly different strips of sky about three minutes apart, a genuine celestial signal should have appeared in both. The fact that it appeared in only one has been a source of debate since 1977.

Some researchers argue this means the signal turned on and off, appearing during one horn's pass but not the other's. Others suggest it could be an artifact of the telescope's design or calibration. Neither explanation is fully satisfying.

Based on which horn detected it, the signal came from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. More specifically, it originated from a region of sky near the star group Chi Sagittarii. There are no known stars, planets, or other obvious sources in that exact direction.

Using data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, amateur astronomer Alberto Caballero identified a Sun-like star, 2MASS 19281982-2640123, as a potential source candidate. It's a G-type star similar to our Sun, located about 1,800 light-years away. This is speculative, though. We don't know if the signal came from a star system at all.

## Why Hasn't Anyone Found It Again?

This is the single most frustrating aspect of the Wow! Signal. Despite dozens of follow-up observations using increasingly powerful equipment, no one has ever detected the signal again.

Robert Gray, an amateur astronomer who became obsessed with the Wow! Signal, conducted the most systematic search efforts. In 1995 and 1996, he used the META array at Oak Ridge Observatory to search the same region. In 1999, he obtained time on the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, one of the world's most powerful radio telescope systems. He pointed it at the exact coordinates and found nothing.

The SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array has also observed the region multiple times without success. If the signal were a continuously broadcasting beacon, someone would have found it by now.

There are several explanations for the non-repetition:

**It was a one-time transmission.** If an alien civilization sent a single, directed signal, there's no reason to expect it would repeat. We send one-time transmissions ourselves, like the Arecibo Message beamed toward the globular cluster M13 in 1974.

**It's intermittent.** The signal might repeat on a cycle we haven't caught. If it broadcasts once every few years, or even once every few decades, the chances of our telescopes being pointed at exactly the right spot at exactly the right time are slim.

**The source has moved or changed.** If the signal came from a spacecraft rather than a planet, the source might no longer be in the same location.

**It was a terrestrial or solar system source.** Despite the signal matching celestial criteria, it's possible that some unusual earthly or near-Earth phenomenon produced it. This brings us to the leading skeptical explanations.

## Could It Have Been a Comet?

In 2017, astronomer Antonio Paris published a paper proposing that the Wow! Signal was caused by a hydrogen cloud surrounding one of two comets, 266P/Christensen or 335P/Gibbs, that would have been in the right part of the sky at the time. Comets release hydrogen gas as they approach the Sun, and this hydrogen emits at, you guessed it, 1420 MHz.

Paris conducted observations of 266P/Christensen as it returned in 2017 and reported detecting a signal at 1420 MHz. He concluded the comet hypothesis was viable.

However, the scientific community has been largely skeptical of this explanation. Several major objections have been raised:

The comets in question weren't discovered until decades after 1977 and wouldn't have been expected to produce a signal as strong as what was detected. The Big Ear telescope would have needed the comet to produce an unusually intense hydrogen emission, far beyond what's typically observed from cometary sources.

The signal was narrowband. Cometary hydrogen emissions are typically broadband, spread across a range of frequencies. A comet shouldn't produce the kind of tight, focused signal that was detected.

The signal appeared in only one feed horn. A comet would be a diffuse source that should have appeared in both.

Jerry Ehman himself, along with other SETI researchers, published a rebuttal noting these issues. While the comet hypothesis can't be completely ruled out, most experts consider it unlikely.

## What Do Scientists Think Today?

The scientific consensus on the Wow! Signal is essentially "we don't know." It doesn't fit neatly into any existing category: not quite natural, not conclusively artificial, and not repeated.

Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute, has described it as "intriguing but not convincing" as evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. The problem, as he and others have noted, is that a single detection without repetition can't be verified or studied further.

Ehman himself was cautious about jumping to conclusions. In a 1994 interview, he said: "I should have written 'Huh!' instead of 'Wow!' People have read too much into the word." He maintained throughout his life that the signal was genuinely anomalous but that identifying it as extraterrestrial would require detecting it again.

The signal sits in an uncomfortable middle ground. It's too unusual to dismiss and too singular to confirm. It matches every theoretical prediction for what an extraterrestrial signal should look like, but it violates the one criterion that matters most: reproducibility.

## What Would It Mean If It Was Extraterrestrial?

Let's indulge the possibility for a moment. If the Wow! Signal was a genuine transmission from an intelligent civilization, what would that tell us?

First, it would mean that whatever sent the signal understood hydrogen line astronomy, which implies a civilization with at least our level of scientific understanding. They chose the frequency deliberately, knowing that any technically capable species would be monitoring it.

Second, the signal's strength suggests it was either very powerful or relatively close (in cosmic terms). A civilization beaming a signal at 1420 MHz strong enough for the Big Ear to detect from thousands of light-years away would need a transmitter far more powerful than anything we've built.

Third, the non-repetition might tell us something about their intent. If it was a single, directed transmission rather than a continuous beacon, it suggests a civilization that's aware of our general direction but not specifically targeting us. Or it could mean they're sweeping the sky, sending brief signals in many directions.

The implications would be staggering. Even a signal from a civilization that no longer exists (remember, light-years mean time delay) would fundamentally change our understanding of our place in the universe. We'd know, definitively, that we're not alone. That intelligence isn't a fluke unique to Earth.

But we're getting ahead of the evidence. As of now, the Wow! Signal remains a data point, an extraordinary one, but just one data point. And as Carl Sagan famously said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

## The Search Continues

The search for signals like the Wow! Signal hasn't stopped. If anything, it's accelerated. Breakthrough Listen, a $100 million initiative funded by Yuri Milner, is conducting the most comprehensive SETI search in history using some of the world's largest radio telescopes. China's FAST telescope, the largest single-dish radio telescope ever built, has joined the search as well.

New technology means that future detections would be far better characterized than the Wow! Signal was. Modern radio telescopes can determine signal direction with much greater precision, analyze signal characteristics in real-time, and immediately trigger follow-up observations.

If the Wow! Signal repeats, or if something like it appears again, we'll be ready. Until then, it stands as a tantalizing reminder that the universe might be trying to tell us something. We just haven't figured out the message yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does the Wow! Signal code "6EQUJ5" mean?

The sequence 6EQUJ5 represents the intensity of the signal over time using an alphanumeric code. Numbers 1-9 represent low to moderate intensities, then letters A through Z represent increasingly higher intensities. "U" represents a signal-to-noise ratio of about 30, meaning the signal was roughly 30 times stronger than the background noise. The sequence shows the signal rising in intensity, peaking at "U," and then falling off as the source passed through the telescope's beam.

### Who discovered the Wow! Signal?

The signal was detected automatically by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope on August 15, 1977. Astronomer Jerry Ehman identified it as anomalous when reviewing the computer printout several days later. He circled the sequence in red ink and wrote "Wow!" in the margin, giving the signal its now-famous name.

### Has the Wow! Signal ever been detected again?

No. Despite numerous attempts using increasingly sophisticated equipment, including the Very Large Array and the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array, no one has detected the signal again from the same region of sky. This non-repetition is the primary reason scientists can't confirm or deny its origin.

### Could the Wow! Signal have been from Earth?

It's unlikely. The signal's characteristics, including its 72-second duration matching the telescope's beam width, its narrowband profile at the hydrogen line frequency, and its intensity pattern, are all consistent with a celestial source rather than a terrestrial one. The Big Ear also had safeguards against terrestrial interference. However, some unusual earthly or atmospheric phenomenon that hasn't been identified can't be completely excluded.

### Is the Wow! Signal proof of alien life?

No. While the signal matches theoretical predictions for what an extraterrestrial transmission should look like, a single unrepeated detection isn't sufficient evidence to conclude it was sent by an intelligent civilization. Proof would require detecting the signal again, ideally by multiple independent observatories, and ruling out all natural and terrestrial explanations. It remains the best candidate for a potential extraterrestrial signal, but "best candidate" isn't the same as proof.
